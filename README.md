# SimpleGame
This is a simple cooking game I created to work on my Javascript.
At first I tried to work with simple vanilla javascript but got stuck. So I have moved on to creating this game using React.js.

This cooking game will have multiple recipes but for now we will just have a beef stew recipe to start with.

## How to play
Click start and pick a recipe to cook.
Follow the recipe by clicking the ingredients to make the meal.
